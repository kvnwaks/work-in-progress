## Deployment

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages.

1. Go to your repository's **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Select the **gh-pages** branch
4. Click **Save**

The workflow will automatically deploy your site whenever you push to the `main` branch. Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name/`

**Note:** The workflow keeps your `main` branch unchanged - it only creates/updates the `gh-pages` branch with the deployed site. This is particularly useful if you have a custom domain, as GitHub Pages may create a CNAME file in the deployment branch. By keeping changes isolated to the `gh-pages` branch, your `main` branch remains untouched and, if forked, can continue syncing from the source repo without conflicts.
